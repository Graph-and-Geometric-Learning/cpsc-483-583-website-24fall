        <v-card-text>I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Yale University. My research focus includes algorithms for graph neural networks, geometric embeddings, explainable models, and more recently, multi-modal foundation models involving relational reasoning. I am the author of many widely used GNN algorithms such as GraphSAGE, PinSAGE and GNNExplainer. In addition, I have worked on a variety of applications of graph learning in physical simulations, social networks, knowledge graphs, neuroscience and biotechnology. I developed the first billion-scale graph embedding services at Pinterest, and the graph-based anomaly detection algorithm at Amazon.</v-card-text>
